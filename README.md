# Real-Time Web Chat with React, TypeScript, and Vite

This project is a simple real-time chat application, similar to Telegram, created using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app leverages browser WebSockets for real-time communication, allowing multiple users to send messages and see updates instantly without needing to refresh or make additional HTTP requests.

## Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Messages sent by any user are instantly reflected in the chat for all participants.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Uses the browser WebSocket API to maintain an open connection to the server, enabling immediate message updates across clients.
- **React + TypeScript**: Built with React and TypeScript for a scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Fast Development with Vite**: Fast Refresh and HMR (Hot Module Replacement) support for a smooth development experience.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Includes ESLint configuration with recommended rules for type-checking, styling, and React support.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Connect to the chat**: Once the server is running, you can open multiple browser windows or share the URL with others to see real-time chat updates.

## ESLint Configuration

This project uses an extended ESLint configuration to enhance type-checking and styling rules. Below are the key configurations added for production-quality code:

- **Type-Aware Linting**: ESLint is configured to be type-aware by enabling type-checked rules.
- **React Plugin**: The `eslint-plugin-react` has been added to enforce React-specific linting rules.

### Configuration Details

- **TypeScript Linting**:

  ```js
  export default tseslint.config({
    languageOptions: {
      parserOptions: {
        project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
        tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
      },
    },
  });
  ```

- **React Plugin and Rules**:

  ```js
  // eslint.config.js
  import react from "eslint-plugin-react";

  export default tseslint.config({
    settings: { react: { version: "18.3" } },
    plugins: { react },
    rules: {
      ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
      ...react.configs["jsx-runtime"].rules,
    },
  });
  ```

## Future Improvements

- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for more personalized chat experiences.
- **Private Chats**: Implement the ability to create private rooms for one-on-one or group conversations.
- **Enhanced Styling**: Improve the UI for a more visually appealing chat interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **TypeScript**: To add static typing and enhance code reliability
- **Vite**: For a fast development environment with HMR and build optimization
- **WebSockets**: Using the browser WebSocket API to enable real-time message streaming
